# Jays_KiCAD_Library
Symbols and Footprints for some components in KiCAD 5.x by Jay Cordaro

Directions: clone this repo.  import symbols using 'Symbol Editor' and footprints using 'Footprint Editor'
I exported them as discrete symbols and footprints because you may want to import them into different libraries

All of the symbols in the library have been validated with an actual PCB.
